Wassup tankers, if you are into(or not) mods and you have ever wondered: "ðŸ¤” It will be epic if":
- I can load any tank remodel runtime
- I can change the maps look runtime
- I can change *some* UI elements runtime
- I can change my hangar *runtime*
- I can make my own custom Data folder
... Well this script will be everything you have ever wondered about.
---
**Disclaimer**
- In regards for the UI elements:
 - I will only add the ones that I use.
  - Crew's voices, gun sounds and sights from MuzMods, some icons and maps resting from DorTep.
- Then you will have some choices for tanks remodeling and also for hangars (only the best ones).
---

- This script is full bash, so in the current status is ready-to-go only for Linux Users.

- Next steps:
 - get the script working on Windows
 - implement a more modern graphical interface

- So if you enjoy the script pls consider to donate anything you want for paying my time spent in the development ðŸ¥°
