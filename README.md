Welcome to my custom modpack for WOTB.

In the mod you will find:
	- Restiled maps
	- Tanks remodeling
	- Custom sight
	- Custom UI interface elements
	- Custom Gun/Crew/UI sounds
	- Custom Icons UI/BattleHUD

- Before merging the Data folder make sure to have a backup copy of your Data folder, if something goes wrong you can always restore that, by a radical replace to aimed corrupted files sobstitution.

-p.s: If you want to install other tanks remodeling be sure to add every file in the right path, but keep a copy of the .scg and .sc2 file for the older remodel, in this way you can switch form a remodel to another.

- The install.sh simply merge the Custom Data folder into the OG Data folder.

- ATTENTION!! The install.sh works only for Linux file-systems (for now) and only for those who have installed the Steam app through fedora rpm  and not for the flatpack one (for now). p.s: (the flatpack version of Steam install the game files into a different path (not .local/... but into .var/...)
