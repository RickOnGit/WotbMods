My Repository aims to give to you the options for modding wotb and restoring files to the og version.

- IMPORTANT: This repository has remodelings mainly for tier 10 and here and there for some lower tiers (really few remoledings out there).

- IMPORTANT: I'm not responsable for your own actions, I just give a tool for make your modding experience more enjoiable, if you are not aware about the risks of modding and you lack in knowlege about WOTB mods DO NOT PROCEED. Anyway use this tool/repo at your own risk.

- The Installation folder will give you the opportunity to download some mods from a server and automaticaly apply those ones.

- If something goes wrong run the backup program for restoring the latest modification.

- Modding is fun but also very risky expecialy because you may not know what are you doing exactly and it's really easy ending up in breaking the game. So my advice is to run the script step by step and taking a look if everything goes right, from tanks remodeling to UI elements to sound, hangar ect...

- Remember that any mistake can lead to unistalling and reinstalling the whole game so before modding watch some yt videos about it, articles ect... always make a backup for each WG og's file before rewriting.

-The scrips and the backup files will be constantly updated.
